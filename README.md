make run           # Start the application
make dev           # Set up development environment
make test          # Run tests
make lint          # Run code linting
make format        # Format code with black/isort
make clean         # Clean up temporary files
```

**Using Poetry directly:**

```bash
poetry install     # Install dependencies
poetry run python pii_redactor_app.py    # Run app
poetry shell       # Activate virtual environment
```

**Development workflow:**

```bash
make dev           # Set up dev environment
make format        # Format code
make lint          # Check code quality
make test          # Run tests
```

- Windows: Double-click `run_app.bat`
- macOS/Linux: `./run_app.sh`

**Manual way:**

```bash
# If using virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

python pii_redactor_app.py
```

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload CSV File**

   - Click "📁 Upload CSV File" button
   - Select your Zendesk export or any CSV file
   - File information will display in the sidebar

2. **Preview First Column** (Optional but Recommended)

   - Click "👁 Preview First Column"
   - Review the redaction results in the Processing tab
   - Ensure the redaction is working as expected

3. **Start Full Redaction**

   - Click "🚀 Start Redaction"
   - Monitor progress with real-time ETA
   - View cost accumulation during processing

4. **Review Results**

   - Switch between Original/Redacted/Side-by-Side views in Preview tab
   - Check processing log in Processing tab
   - View history in History tab

5. **Save Output**
   - Redacted file is automatically saved with timestamp
   - Format: `original_name_redacted_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
   - Saved in the same directory as the input file

- **Memory Efficient**: Handles large CSV files without loading entire file in memory
- **Multi-threading**: UI remains responsive during processing

## 🛠️ Advanced Configuration

### Using Local PII Detection (No Azure)

If you don't have Azure credentials, the app includes a fallback regex-based detector:

```python
# In pii_redactor_app.py, modify the redact_pii_text method:
from azure_pii_detector import LocalPIIDetector

# Use local detector instead
local_detector = LocalPIIDetector()
redacted = local_detector.redact_text(text)
```

### Customizing PII Categories

Edit the `PII_ENTITY_MAP` in `azure_pii_detector.py` to customize redaction labels:

```python
PII_ENTITY_MAP = {
    'Person': '[REDACTED_NAME]',  # Custom label
    'Email': '[REDACTED_EMAIL]',
    # Add more customizations
}
```

### Adjusting Batch Size

For better performance with large files, adjust batch size:

```python
# In azure_pii_detector.py
def detect_and_redact_dataframe(self, df, columns=None, batch_size=50):  # Increase from 25
```

## 📊 Database Schema

The application uses SQLite to store processing history:

```sql
CREATE TABLE redaction_history (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    timestamp TEXT,
    filename TEXT,
    rows_processed INTEGER,
    columns_processed INTEGER,
    cost REAL,
    duration_seconds REAL,
    status TEXT
);
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Azure credentials not found"**

   - Ensure `.env` file exists with correct credentials
   - Or use Settings menu to configure credentials

2. **"Azure connection failed"**

   - Verify endpoint URL format (must include https://)
   - Check API key is valid
   - Ensure internet connection is active

3. **Slow Processing**

   - Large files may take time (check ETA)
   - Consider processing in smaller batches
   - Ensure stable internet connection

4. **Memory Issues**
   - For very large files (>1GB), process in chunks
   - Close other applications to free memory

### Debug Mode

Add debug logging by modifying the logger in the main app:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

- **Processing Speed**: ~100-500 rows/minute (depends on columns and content)
- **Memory Usage**: ~200-500MB for typical files
- **API Latency**: 50-200ms per batch (25 cells)
- **Accuracy**: 95%+ PII detection rate with Azure AI

## 🔐 Security Notes

- API keys are stored locally in `.env` file
- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Processing history stored locally in SQLite
- No data is retained by Azure after processing
- All processing happens over HTTPS
